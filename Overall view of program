The purpose of this program is to understand and follow the complete flow of designing a System-on-Chip (SoC), starting from initial specifications to the fabrication-ready physical chip. This overview captures what we will be doing in the program.


1)Chip Modeling (O1)

Start with high-level specifications of the chip’s behavior.

Develop a C model and a testbench to verify functionality.

Goal: Understand what the chip is supposed to do.

2)RTL Architecture (O2)

Convert the C model into RTL (Verilog/VHDL).

Define the major blocks like processor, peripherals, and IPs.

Output: RTL description ready for integration.

3)SoC Integration (O3)

Synthesize RTL to gate-level netlist.

Combine processor, macros, analog IPs, and GPIOs to form a complete SoC.

Goal: Learn how all blocks are integrated into a functional SoC.

4)Physical Implementation (RTL → GDSII)

Floorplan and place blocks on the chip.

Connect the blocks and optimize area, timing, and power.

Key point: Understand hard macros (fixed layout) vs soft logic (synthesized from RTL).

Final Signoff

Perform checks like DRC (Design Rule Check) and LVS (Layout vs Schematic).

Output: GDSII file ready for fabrication.

Manufacturing

Send the GDSII file to a semiconductor fab.

Learn how the chip is fabricated on silicon wafers.
